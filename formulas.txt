equations broken down from this research paper

α = how much we favor pheremone values
β = how much we favor hueristic values

τ = pheremone value thingy
η = hueristic value = 1 / (distance(i,j))
N = set of cities ant has not visited

p(k)(i,j)(t) = probability ant k will leave city i and go to city j (assuming j is in N) at generation t

  ((τ(i,j) ^ α) * ((η(i,j) ^ β))  # numerator
= ------------------------------------------ # division line
  SUM all cities l in N ((τ(i,l) ^ α) * ((η(i,l) ^ β))   # denominator

basically the denominator is the sum of all numerators if that makes sense
This shit is used for constructing the tour and guiding our ants

Onto the pheremone stuff

t = current generation
ρ = pheremone trail evaportation rate   0 < ρ <= 1
L(k) = length of ant k's tour

τ(i,j)(t+1) = (1 - ρ) * τ(i,j)(t) + SUM all ants k ( Δτ(k)(i,j)(t)  )

where
Δτ(k)(i,j)(t) = 1 / L(k)(t)  (Each ants pheremone strength is determined by the fitness of their tour)
if ant k took path (i,j)
and
Δτ(k)(i,j)(t) = 0
if ant k did not take path (i,j)

Basically, the pheremone strength for the next generation is equal to 
  (modifier*curr pheremone strength) + (sum of fitness of all ants who took path (i,j))
